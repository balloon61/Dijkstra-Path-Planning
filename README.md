# Dijkstra
### Dijkstra Path Planning

## Require Lib:
cv2, numpy, queue, heapq, scipy.signal, 
## Step:
```
cd to LOCATION which include the file
python3 Dijkstra-pathplanning-polun-chen.py
```
## Example input
(x, y) = 10 20

### Explaination
The code will split the input string for you. If the point is at the obstacle's pose, or too close to the obstacle (clearance 5 mm)
then you will need to enter again.
After successfuly enter the initial pose, do the same thing in goal pose.

The code will find the whether it has a solution first, if it has one, then visuallize the process.
